Today I would like to share a very good Augmented Reality application that would make to some of us the life a little more easier, and it is a good example where Augmented Reality can do and where can be used.

In this case <a href="http://www.tainicom.net/devTools/accelKit/">AccelKit </a>is a tool that simulates an accelerometer sensor for windows Phone 7, that may simplify our applications testing giving us a more real approach for our accelerometer measurements.

While I've been writing this article I thought that a emulator accelerometer it isn't necesary if Windows Phone 7 has been realised, but in case that you are no lucky enough to have this awesome phone, it is a valid alternative.

So just for testing purposes today I just I've added some flavor to an existent project, nothing too difficult to do, but I did it because I really like the fly demo and is a very good application to learn xna.

First see this demo of the final result:

If you're interested to do it and experiment with Windows Phone 7  <a href="http://cid-86b4ae59157bdbba.office.live.com/self.aspx/Wp7%20projects/Fly%20Demo%20and%20Augmented%20Reality%20WP7.rar">Grab the files and tools </a>

and follow this mini tutorial that I've prepared:

I would like to thanks to: <a href="http://blog.nkast.gr/post/2010/09/19/AccelKit-an-Augmented-Reality-Accelerometer-Kit-for-Windows-Phone-7-Emulator.aspx">Nikos Kastellanos</a> for <a href="http://www.tainicom.net/devTools/accelKit/">accelKit</a> And <a href="http://geeks.ms/blogs/jcanton/">Javier Ferrero</a> for the<a href="http://xnacommunity.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Accelerometer"> fly demo</a> .

May the code be with you!.

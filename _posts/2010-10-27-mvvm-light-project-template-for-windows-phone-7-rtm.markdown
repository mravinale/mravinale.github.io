Today I would like to share a project template ready to build great windows phone 7 applications using Mvvm Light, first of all this this project template is an update that I made from the current Mvvm Light project hosted on codeplex: <a href="http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/">http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/</a> my favorite toolkit to build Silverlight and Windows Phone 7 applications.

Besides to make it compatible for the current tools version, and support the Laurent Bugnion Project, I just added a very simple reactive extensions example, in order to make it ready to work with services in our model.

remember to paste the .zip on project templates folder.

Example:
